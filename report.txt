Title: Driving Climate Action with Machine Learning: Predicting Vehicle CO₂ Emissions

Sustainable Development Goal: SDG 13 – Climate Action

Problem:
Transportation is a leading source of global CO₂ emissions. However, consumers and policymakers often lack tools to estimate how individual car choices impact the environment.

Solution:
This project uses supervised machine learning (Linear Regression) to predict CO₂ emissions based on vehicle specifications such as make, model, class, and engine size. By doing so, it promotes awareness and facilitates greener transport decisions.

Dataset:
We used an open dataset of vehicle characteristics and CO₂ output, with columns including "Make", "Model", "Engine Size(L)", and "CO2 Emissions(g/km)".

Model Summary:
- Algorithm: Linear Regression
- Features: Make, Model, Vehicle Class, Engine Size(L)
- Target: CO₂ Emissions(g/km)
- MAE: XX.XX
- R² Score: X.XX

Ethical Considerations:
The model relies on available vehicle data, which may omit certain regional or electric car options. For fairness, the dataset covers a broad range of manufacturers and models.

Impact:
By forecasting CO₂ emissions, the model supports responsible consumption and policy evaluation aligned with SDG 13.
